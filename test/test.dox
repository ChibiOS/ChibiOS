 * @page testsuite Testing Strategy
 * <h2>Description</h2>
 * Most of the ChibiOS/RT demos link a set of software modules (test suite) in
 * order to verify the proper working of the kernel, the port and the demo
 * itself.
 *
 * <h2>Strategy by Component</h2>
 * The OS components are tested in various modes depending on their importance:
 * - <b>Kernel</b>. The kernel code is subject to rigorous testing. The test
 *   suite aims to test <b>all</b> the kernel code and reach a code coverage
 *   as close to 100% as possible. In addition to the code coverage, the kernel
 *   code is tested for <b>functionality</b> and benchmarked for <b>speed</b>
 *   and <b>size</b> before each stable release. In addition to the code
 *   coverage and functional testing a <b>batch compilation test</b> is
 *   performed before each release, the kernel is compiled by alternatively
 *   enabling and disabling all the various configuration options, the
 *   kernel code is expected to compile without errors nor warnings and
 *   execute the test suite without failures (a specific simulator is used
 *   for this execution test, it is done automatically by a script because
 *   the entire sequence can take hours).<br>
 *   All the tests results are included as reports in the OS distribution
 *   under @p ./docs/reports.
 * - <b>Ports</b>. The port code is tested by executing the kernel test
 *   suite on the target hardware. A port is validated only if it passes all
 *   the tests. Speed and size benchmarks for all the supported architectures
 *   are performed, both size and speed regressions are <b>monitored</b>.
 * - <b>HAL</b>. The HAL high level code and device drivers implementations
 *   are tested by use in the various demos and/or by users.
 * - <b>Various</b>. The miscellaneous code is tested by use in the various
 *   demos and/or by users.
 * - <b>External Code</b>. Not tested, external libraries or components are
 *   used as-is or with minor patching where required, problems are usually
 *   reported upstream.
 * .
 * <h2>Kernel Test Suite</h2>
 * The kernel test suite is divided in modules or test sequences. Each Test
 * Module performs a series of tests on a specified kernel subsystem or
 * subsystems and can report a failure/success status and/or a performance
 * index as the test suite output.<br>
 * The test suite is usually activated in the demo applications by pressing a
 * button on the target board, see the readme into the various demos
 * directories. The test suite output is usually sent through a serial port
 * and can be examined by using a terminal emulator program.
