ChibiOS next is composed of several independent but inter-operable
sub-projects: RT, NIL, HAL.

*** ChibiOS next highlights ****

This release is focused on RTOS general improvements, both RT and NIL received
a series of important new features.

*** ChibiOS next general improvements ***

- Rationalized source tree to reduce code duplication.
- Shared RTOS components, now allocators, mailboxes and binary semaphores
  are usable by both RT and NIL.
- Shared ports architecture. Now RTOS ports work for both RT and NIL, no
  more duplication.
- MPU use for hardware stack checking in ARMCMx port.
- Enhanced shell.

*** What's new in RT 4.0.0 ***

- Common ports architecture.
- Ability to use the new shared RTOS components.
- Enhanced trace buffer, it is able to store events regarding not just threads
  but also IRQs, halts and user events. The trace record now stores both the
  "slow" system time and a RT stamp for increased accuracy.
- Enhanced Registry, it is now possible to find threads by name or by pointer.
- New threading API, now creating static threads is even faster.
- Extended priority range to 1..255.
- New kernel hooks for a more flexible code instrumentation.
- Experimental NASA OSAL implementation.

*** What's new in HAL 4.1.0 ***


*** What's new in NIL 2.0.0 ***

- Common ports architecture.
- Ability to use the new shared RTOS components.
- State checker.
- Parameters checks.
