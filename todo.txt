Version 2.5.1

Within 2.5.x:
X Revision of the RTCv2 driver implementation.
X File System infrastructure.
  - FatFs wrapper.
X Streaming DAC/I2S driver model and STM32 implementation.
- Support for STM32F3xx devices.
- Specific I2C driver for STM32F0 and newer devices.
- STM32 CAN2 support.
- Unified LPC1xxx HAL.
  - LPC11xx and LPC13xx HALs merged in the unified one.
  - LPC17xx support.
- NUC140 support.
- Create a null device driver implementing a stream interface.
- Add USARTs support to the STM32 SPI driver.
- Add option to use another counter instead of the systick counter into the
  trace buffer.
- Add a chSysIntegrityCheck() API to the kernel.
- Add guard pages as extra stack checking mechanism. Guard pages should be
  of the same type of the stack alignment type.
- Add a CH_THREAD macro for threads declaration in order to hide
  compiler-specific optimizations for thread functions. All demos will have
  to be updated.
- Runtime errors manager in HAL.
- Critical errors manager in HAL (to replace or complement assertions).
- Add ADC3 support to the STM32F1xx ADC driver.
- Update C++ wrapper.
? Add the RTC service inside the kernel and port, remove from HAL.

Within 2.x.x
- Software I2C implementation using a GPT instance for timings.
- Static memory allocation hook macros in kernel code.
X Implement the "transmission end" serial driver event on those platforms
  supporting the feature, so far only done in STM32 driver.
- Test suite overhaul, the API should be more generic in order to be used
  with different subsystems and not just the kernel.
- Reduce number of demos globally, add demos to a repository or on web site.
  Required in order to reduce support effort.
- New device driver models: Clock, Systick, WDG.
- Add UART4 support to the STM32 UART driver (CL line only, HD has a nasty
  shared interrupt).
- Shared DMA channels support in the STM8L HAL.
- Device drivers for STM8/STM8L (ADC, PWM, bring them on par with STM32).
- Device drivers for LPC1xxx (ADC, PWM, bring them on par with STM32).
- Implement USB Mass Storage Class support.
- Batch testing of the ARM7/ARMCMx port using OpenOCD, with reports.
X Transactional flash file system implementation.
- Serial over UART complex driver driver, evaluate from the performance
  results if to make obsolete the current dedicated Serial driver.
- Official segmented interrupts support and abstraction in CMx port.
- MAC driver revision in order to support copy-less operations, this will
  require changes to lwIP or a new TCP/IP stack however.
- Threads Pools manager in the library.
- Dedicated TCP/IP stack.
? Evaluate if change thread functions to return void is worthwhile. 
? Add a *very simple* ADC API for single one shot sampling (implement it as
  an injected conversion on the STM32).
? Add a switch to enable/disable the priority inheritance algorithm in mutexes.
? ISO7816 driver over UART driver, both reader and card side.
? Merge the Coldfire branch in mainline (hardware missing).
? Merge the H8S branch in mainline (hardware missing).

Ideas for 3.x.x:
- MMU/MPU support.
- High resolution timers and tickless kernel.
- Multicore support.

Side projects:
X ChibiOS Wizard, UML modeling and ChibiOS applications code and
  documentation generator.
