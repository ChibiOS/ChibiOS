*** SB-related notes and ideas ***

x Move u_psp and s_psp fields from the thread context to the sandbox object.
  + Reducing size for threads not associated to sandboxes.
  + Move the unprivileged thread creation code from port to sb is more
    architecturally elegant.
  + Can pass "sbp" from call to return handlers through system stack, faster.
  - Creating a strong assumption for one-thread-per-sandbox.

x Remove the "p" pointer from the thread context and use the "object" pointer
  already present in the thread_t structure.
  + SB is a "controller" so it makes sense and saves space.

x The pointer to the SB object could be passed by the dispatcher to the
  syscalls avoiding this code in all functions.
    sb_class_t *sbp = (sb_class_t *)chThdGetSelfX()->ctx.syscall.p;

* Use und#xxx instruction for syscall instead of svc#xxx.
  + Faster context switch.
  + Requires to enable USBFAULTENA and give UsageFault a priority.
    + Enable all other vectors and make a proper handler finally.
  - Syscall code would disturb fast interrupts because higher handler priority.

* EXCRETURN of syscall-return SVC can be expected to be the same of syscall SVC
  because it is the same thread doing it and the syscall code is not supposed
  to use the FPU and cause FPCA setting.

NOTE: CONTROL is required in context also for FPU modes 2 and 3 because
      the FPCA bit needs to be preserved for each thread (done).
