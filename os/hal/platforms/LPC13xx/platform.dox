 *
 * @section lpc13xx_pal_4 Suboptimal behavior
 * Some GPIO features are less than optimal:
 * - Pad/port toggling operations are not atomic.
 * - Pull-up and Pull-down resistors cannot be programmed through the PAL
 *   driver and must be programmed separately using the IOCON peripheral.
 * - Reading of the output latch for pads programmed as input is not possible,
 *   the input pin value is returned instead.

/**
 * @defgroup LPC13xx_SPI LPC13xx SSP Support
 * @details The SPI driver supports the LPC13xx SSP peripherals in an interrupt
 *          driven implementation.
 * @note    Being the SPI a fast peripheral, much care must be taken to
 *          not saturate the CPU bandwidth with an excessive IRQ rate. The
 *          maximum transfer bit rate is likely limited by the IRQ
 *          handling.

 * @section lpc13xx_spi_1 Supported HW resources
 * - SSP0.
 * - SSP1 (where present).
 * .
 * @section lpc13xx_spi_2 LPC13xx SPI driver implementation features
 * - Clock stop for reduced power usage when the driver is in stop state.
 * - Each SSP can be independently enabled and programmed. Unused
 *   peripherals are left in low power mode.
 * - Fully interrupt driven.
 * - Programmable interrupt priority levels for each SSP.
