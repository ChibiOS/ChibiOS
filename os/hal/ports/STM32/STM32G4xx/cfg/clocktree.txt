Clock point definition:

- All generated symbols are prefixed by a common string (STM32_ for example).
- Each clock point has a symbolic name (HSI, LSE, PLL1VCO etc).
- Each clock point defines a clock VALUE macro with a suffix (_CK for example).
  - Clock values can be:
    - Constant
    - Constant with on/off switch
    - Selectable from a set of constant values
      - Implies a setting
      - Check on the setting
      - Generates a _REG constant for register initialization.
    - Selectable from a set of other clock points (MUXes)
      - Implies a setting.
      - Check on the setting.
      - Values calculated on setting.
      - Generates a _REG constant for register initialization.
    - Calculated from another clock point
      - Divider style
      - Multiplier style (PLLs)
      - A min-max check for the generated clock value is generated.
      - Generates a _REG constant for register initialization.
