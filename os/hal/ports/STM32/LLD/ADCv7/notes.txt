STM32 ADCv7 driver.

Driver capability:

- Supports the STM32 \"fast\" ADC cell integrated in the STM32U3 sub-family.
  Conversion groups must provide the PCSEL mask and the split AWDx threshold
  registers expected by this ADC implementation.

The file registry must export:

STM32_HAS_ADCx                  - ADCx presence flag (1..4).
STM32_ADC1_HANDLER              - IRQ vector name for ADC1.
STM32_ADC1_NUMBER               - IRQ vector number for ADC1.
STM32_ADC2_HANDLER              - IRQ vector name for ADC2.
STM32_ADC2_NUMBER               - IRQ vector number for ADC2.
