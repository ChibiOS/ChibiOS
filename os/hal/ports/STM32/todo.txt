- The varios oscillator .inc files in RCC always report the base frequency
  regardless if the oscillator is enabled or not, the macros need to
  be aligned to the following standard:
    STM32_OSCXXCLK_BASE	    - Frequency of the base oscillator before any
                              programmable divider. It reports the oscillator
                              frequency regardless of the enable state.
    STM32_OSCXXCLK          - Frequency of the oscillator after dividers,
                              zero if the oscillator is disabled. Only
                              meaningful in static clocks mode.
