 * @defgroup MMC_SPI MMC over SPI Driver
 * @brief Generic MMC driver.
 * @details This module implements a portable MMC driver that uses a SPI
 *          driver as physical layer.
 * @pre     In order to use the MMC_SPI driver the @p HAL_USE_MMC_SPI option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section mmc_spi_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
