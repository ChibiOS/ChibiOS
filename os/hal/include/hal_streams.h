 * @brief   Data streams.
 * @details This header defines abstract interfaces useful to access generic
 *          data streams in a standardized way.
 *
 * @addtogroup HAL_STREAMS
 * @details This module define an abstract interface for generic data streams.
 *          Note that no code is present, just abstract interfaces-like
 *          structures, you should look at the system as to a set of
 *          abstract C++ classes (even if written in C). This system
 *          has then advantage to make the access to data streams
 *          independent from the implementation logic.<br>
 *          The stream interface can be used as base class for high level
 *          object types such as files, sockets, serial ports, pipes etc.
