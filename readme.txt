*** Releases and Change Log                                               ***
*****************************************************************************

*** Next ***
- NEW: Add support for HFSEL to DACv1.
- NEW: Added MPU initialization settings in ARMv7-M, ARv7-M-ALT, ARMv8-ML-ALT
       ports. Settings allow to statically initialize any region.
- NEW: Improved interrupts processing in ARMv7-M-ALT and ARMv8-M-ML-ALT
       ports. Specifically, saved few cycles on the context switch code path.
- NEW: Added missing context switch hook in ARMv7-M-ALT and ARMv8-M-ML-ALT
       ports.
- NEW: I2C slave support in ST low level drivers.
- NEW: Support for STM32G0B0xx.
- NEW: Added chRegGarbageCollect() function to registry for simplified
       dynamic threads management.
- NEW: Added integration demos for VFS+LittleFS/FatFS+XSHELL.
- NEW: Added faster context switch modes to ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M ports. The
       new modes allow to avoid saving FP context for threads that do not
       use the FPU.
- NEW: Added new ARMv8-M port aligned with features of then ARMv7-M port for
       sandboxing.
- NEW: Added XShell support for change prompt, multi-command per line, line 
       editing, user definable extra fields, init and execution hooks.
- NEW: Improved LFS support, now it is possible to make an LFS file system
       at arbitrary positions in flash.
- NEW: New XSNOR framework replacing the old serial_nor. It allows multiple
       device types on multiple interfaces and devices auto-detection.
       STM32-WSPI-MFS demo modified to showcase the new capabilities.
       The old serial_nor is still available but no more developed.
- NEW: New XShell specific for the new RT, it leverages the new thread
       dispose feature.
- NEW: New RT threads spawning API decoupling the thread stack from the
       thread_t structure as required in NUMA multicore devices. Old
       "create" API is still present and supported, long term it could be
       removed.
- NEW: Added capability to associate a "dispose" functions to threads,
       dynamic API modified to use this mechanism.
- NEW: ADCv4 now can use regular DMA also for ADC3 unit.
- NEW: Recursive locks in RT and NIL made optional, only enabled if the
       underlying port supports the capability.
- NEW: Added STM32 FDCANv2 for STM32H7xx
- NEW: Now RT virtual timers can recalculate the value of CH_CFG_ST_TIMEDELTA
       at runtime and continue using the recalculated value. This has two
       consequences: 1) The value is recalculated once 2) it is possible
       to use the new API chVTGetCurrentDelta() and update the static
       setting in order to avoid recalculation.
- NEW: OSLIB release methods now return the value of the reference counter.
- NEW: Support for STM32C0xx.
- NEW: Improved DAC driver, updated STM32 DACv1.
- NEW: STM32 RTCv2 and RTCv3 modified to not use shadow registers.
- NEW: Enhanced STM32F7xx MPU configuration in mcuconf.h.
- NEW: I2C slave support in HAL high level driver.
- NEW: Added settings for STM32 OCTOSPIv1 and OCTOSPIv2 TCR bits SSHIFT and
       DHQC.
- NEW: Automatic removal of duplicated inclusion paths on make command lines.
- NEW: Reworked STM32 SDMMCv1 and SDMMCv2 drivers, better timeout and clock
       handling, improved speed for aligned buffers.
- NEW: Added a "waend" field to the thread structure in RT for debug
       convenience.
- NEW: Added a para-virtualized HAL port for use in sandboxes.
- NEW: Added a VIO subsystem to sandboxes supporting drivers
       para-virtualization, PAL and SIO supported so far.
- NEW: Added and RT port for use in virtualized sandboxes.
- NEW: Added full virtualization support to sandboxes with a virtual IRQ
       mechanism.
- NEW: Added __CH_OWNEROF() macro to RT.
- NEW: Added a Posix-favored shell named "msh" (Mini Shell). The shell is able
       to run sub-apps inside the same sandbox. The shell can either be placed
       statically in flash or loaded dynamically in RAM.
- NEW: Added runnable "apps" capability to SBs, apps available so far: msh, ls.
- NEW: Added ability to load ELF files to SBs.
- NEW: Enhanced Posix API for SBs leveraging the VFS integration.
- NEW: SBs and VFS integration. Each SB can see its own VFS instance.
- NEW: Added integration of LittleFS on top of our flash infrastructure.
- NEW: Added a new MEM_IS_VALID_FUNCTION() macro to RT and NIL.
- NEW: Changed SB configuration options names to be prefixed with SB_CFG_.
- NEW: Added a new CH_CFG_HARDENING_LEVEL option to RT.
- NEW: Added a chXXXDispose() function to all objects in NIL.
- NEW: Added a chXXXDispose() function to all objects in RT.
- NEW: Added VFS-related commands to the shell, disabled by default.
- NEW: Added a new VFS subsystem (Virtual File System), it allows to assemble
       trees of files from multiple "File System Drivers" into a single tree
       and access it as a whole.
- NEW: Added MEM_NATURAL_ALIGN macro to RT and NIL.
- NEW: Added static initializer for virtual timers in RT.
- NEW: Added new function chHeapIntegrityCheck().
- NEW: Function chCoreGetStatusX() changed to return a memory region object
       instead of a simple size.
- NEW: RT and NIL upgraded to support the enhanced OSLIB.
- NEW: Memory areas/pointers checker functions added to OSLIB.
