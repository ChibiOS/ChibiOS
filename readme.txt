*****************************************************************************

*** Next ***
- NEW: Function chSftIntegrityCheckI() rewritten to be much more efficient in
       performing lists integrity checks.
- NEW: Added to RT a dedicated functional safety module, the function
       chSysIntegrityCheckI() has been moved in this module and renamed to
       chSftIntegrityCheckI().
- NEW: I2Cv4 support added to STM32C0xx, STM32G0xx, STM32G4xx families. This
       driver only require one DMA channel vs two of the old implementations.
- NEW: Added multicore memory classes modifiers to RT in order to support
       NUMA architectures and non-coherent cache architectures.
- NEW: Added MPU initialization settings in ARMv7-M, ARv7-M-ALT, ARMv8-ML-ALT
       ports. Settings allow to statically initialize any region.
- NEW: Improved interrupts processing in ARMv7-M-ALT and ARMv8-M-ML-ALT
       ports. Specifically, saved few cycles on the context switch code path.
- NEW: Added missing context switch hook in ARMv7-M-ALT and ARMv8-M-ML-ALT
       ports.
- NEW: Added chRegGarbageCollect() function to registry for simplified
       dynamic threads management.
- NEW: Added integration demos for VFS+LittleFS/FatFS+XSHELL.
- NEW: Added faster context switch modes to ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M ports. The
       new modes allow to avoid saving FP context for threads that do not
       use the FPU.
- NEW: Added new ARMv8-M port aligned with features of then ARMv7-M port for
       sandboxing.
- NEW: Added XShell support for change prompt, multi-command per line, line 
       editing, user definable extra fields, init and execution hooks.
- NEW: Improved LFS support, now it is possible to make an LFS file system
       at arbitrary positions in flash.
- NEW: New XShell specific for the new RT, it leverages the new thread
       dispose feature.
- NEW: New RT threads spawning API decoupling the thread stack from the
       thread_t structure as required in NUMA multicore devices. Old
       "create" API is still present and supported, long term it could be
       removed.
- NEW: Added capability to associate a "dispose" functions to threads,
       dynamic API modified to use this mechanism.
- NEW: Recursive locks in RT and NIL made optional, only enabled if the
       underlying port supports the capability.
- NEW: Now RT virtual timers can recalculate the value of CH_CFG_ST_TIMEDELTA
       at runtime and continue using the recalculated value. This has two
       consequences: 1) The value is recalculated once 2) it is possible
       to use the new API chVTGetCurrentDelta() and update the static
       setting in order to avoid recalculation.
- NEW: OSLIB release methods now return the value of the reference counter.
- NEW: Added a "waend" field to the thread structure in RT for debug
       convenience.
- NEW: Added a para-virtualized XHAL port for use in sandboxes.
- NEW: Added a VIO subsystem to sandboxes supporting drivers
       para-virtualization, PAL and SIO supported so far.
- NEW: Added and RT port for use in virtualized sandboxes.
- NEW: Added full virtualization support to sandboxes with a virtual IRQ
       mechanism.
- NEW: Added __CH_OWNEROF() macro to RT.
- NEW: Added a Posix-favored shell named "msh" (Mini Shell). The shell is able
       to run sub-apps inside the same sandbox. The shell can either be placed
       statically in flash or loaded dynamically in RAM.
- NEW: Added runnable "apps" capability to SBs, apps available so far: msh, ls.
- NEW: Added ability to load ELF files to SBs.
- NEW: Enhanced Posix API for SBs leveraging the VFS integration.
- NEW: SBs and VFS integration. Each SB can see its own VFS instance.
- NEW: Added a new MEM_IS_VALID_FUNCTION() macro to RT and NIL.
- NEW: Changed SB configuration options names to be prefixed with SB_CFG_.
- NEW: Added a new CH_CFG_HARDENING_LEVEL option to RT.
- NEW: Added a chXXXDispose() function to all objects in NIL.
- NEW: Added a chXXXDispose() function to all objects in RT.
- NEW: Added MEM_NATURAL_ALIGN macro to RT and NIL.
- NEW: Added static initializer for virtual timers in RT.
- NEW: Added new function chHeapIntegrityCheck().
- NEW: Function chCoreGetStatusX() changed to return a memory region object
       instead of a simple size.
- NEW: RT and NIL upgraded to support the enhanced OSLIB.
- NEW: Memory areas/pointers checker functions added to OSLIB.
