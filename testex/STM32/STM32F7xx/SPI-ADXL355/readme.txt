** ChibiOS/HAL + ChibiOS/EX - SPI + ADXL355 demo for STM32F7xx.            **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an STM32 Discovery-F7. It has been tested 
connecting an external the EVAL-ADXL355.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F7xx SPI driver in order
to acquire data from ADXL355 using ChibiOS/EX.

** Board Setup **

With reference to the ADI UG-1030 (EVAL-ADXL354/EVAL-ADXL355 User Guide) and
to the ST UM1907 (STM32 Discovery-F746G User Manual) the following connection
are need:

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
