** ChibiOS/RT port for ARM-Cortex-M3 ADICUP360.                            **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an ADICUP360 board.

** The Demo **

The demo flashes the two on-board LEDs using a thread, by pressing the button 
located on the board (BOOT) the test procedure is activated with output on the 
serial port SD0 (UART0, mapped on the User COM port).

** Board setup **

To redirect P0.6 and P0.7 to the User COM port it is required to setup
the switch matrix as:
 - S1 -> Don't Care
 - S2 -> 0
 - S3 -> Don't Care
 - S4 -> 0
   
** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested by using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
